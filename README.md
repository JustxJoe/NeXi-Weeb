The "files" folder should go in your "Resource Swapper" in your Venge Documents, and the 1056036.json file should go here, too.
The "GLB-Fix.js", however, will go in "UserScripts".
The screenshots are included merely to give a preview of the mod itself (also they are required to consider the mod official), but you may delete them after scrolling through them, as doing so is just fine, and will not hurt the mod in-game.
This mod was released some time in late 2020 by NeXi2k, who most of you don't know, but was a huge name in the community way back then. It is his mod, but I am just updating the outdated stuff, and re-releasing it.
Some known issues are that the GLB-fix will not work for everyone for some reason, and the game will make you float mid-air and you can't move upon loading into a game. If this happens you might have to remove the weapon GLB files, and you can do so by going to Documents, then Venge, then Resource Swapper, and using the search bar at the top right to look for "Weapon" and hit enter. A list of names like "weapon-scar.glb" and "weapon-tec.glb" will pop up. Delete all of them (Note: ONLY do this if the game makes you float mid air... I will try to find a fix for this soon, but if it doesn't work, then for now you will just have to hide your hands and delete the weapon files).
However, if you find any OTHER issues, PM me on discord: Just Joe#0247
Enjoy!
